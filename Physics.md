# Waves

## Chapter 1

### Key Ideas

 1. Types of waves

    Name of waves|Features
    ---|---
    Transverse waves|Waves in which particles of medium oscillate perpendicular to the wave's direction of travel.
    Longitudinal waves| Waves in which particles of medium oscillate parallel to the wave's direction of travel

 2. Sinusoidal wave
   
    Format:

    $$ y(x,t)=y_m sin(kx-\omega t ) $$

    Where $y_m$ is the **amplitude** , $k$ is the **angular wave number** , $\omega$ is the **angular frequency** , $kx-\omega t$ is the **phase**

 3. Formula

    $$\begin{split}
        &k=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\\
        &T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}=\frac{1}{f}\\
        &v(speed)=\frac{\omega}{k}=\frac{\lambda}{T}=\lambda f
    \end{split}$$

 4. Wave expression
   
   Any waves can be represented by a formula like 

   $$y(x,t)=h\sin(kx\pm \omega t)$$

   plus sign denotes a wave travelling to the negative direction and minus sign a wave travelling to the positive direction.

- Waves are of three main types: Mechanical waves;Electromagnetic waves;Matter waves.
- Phase constant $\phi,y_m\sin(kx \pm \omega t \pm \phi)$: Positive of phase constant shifts the curve to the negative direction; Negative phase constant shifts the curve to the positive direction.
- A travelling wave must be represented as $y(x,t)=h(kx\pm \omega t)$
- Transverse velocity $u$ equals to
  
  $$u=\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}$$

- Physical quantities
  
  Name|Formula
  ---|---
  linear density|$\mu =\frac{m}{l}$
  wave speed on strings|$v=\sqrt{\frac{\tau}{\mu}},\tau$ the tension of string


# Thermodynamics

**The zeroth law of thermodynamics**
 
  When two bodies are in thermal equilibrium, their temperatures are equal.

**Measuring temperature**
 
 (1) $273.15 kelvins=0 ^\circ  C$
 
 (2) Celsius temperature scale 
  
  $$T_c=T-273.15k$$

 (3) Farenheit temperature scale 
  
  $$T_F=\frac{9}{5}T_c+32 ^\circ C$$

**Thermal expension**
  
  (1)Linear expension:
  
  $$\Delta L=L \times \alpha \times \Delta T$$
   
  $, \alpha$ is a given constant value
  
  (2)Volume expension: 
   
  $$\Delta V=V \times \beta \times \Delta T$$
   
  ,$\beta =3\alpha \leftarrow$ just in solid.
   
**The Definition of Heat**
   
  Heat is an energy that transferred between system and environment because a temperature difference between them.Heat is a transferred energy and it is not intrinsic property.

**Aborption of heat**
  
  (1)$1$ Calories(Cal)=$4.1868$ Jouls(J)

  (2)<front color=red>Heat Capacity</front>
  
  Heat capacity $C$ is a proportionality constant between the heat absorbed $Q$ and temperature changed $\Delta T:$

  $$Q=C\Delta T$$
